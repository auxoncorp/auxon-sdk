# The Modality SDK

This is Auxon's Modality SDK; a collection of clients, servers,
protocols, and general API types for interacting with the APIs that are
used throughout Auxon's Modality suite of tools.


## Implementations

The current publicly available SDK implementations are:

### Rust

These libraries are the same as or very similar to what is used within
Modality itself.

See the [rust sdk](./client-libraries/rust/) directly for more
information.

### C

The C & C++ FFI for Auxon's Modality SDK.

See the [C sdk](./client-libraries/c/) directly for more
information.
